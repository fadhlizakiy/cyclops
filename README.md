# Cyclops
Cyclops is a python flask based client that utilizes scapy library to perform basic ARP poisoning. Natural use of cyclops is by visiting cyclops.fadhlizakiy.com, hence you can also use CURL for requesting from localhost. There is no data collection done in client-side by Cyclops, as well as in the server-side.

Cyclops is intended for accademic purpose and it is not justified to be used for malicious intent. Using cyclops in public will be easily detected by the network administrator and pin-pointed to you.
